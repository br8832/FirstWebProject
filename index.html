Over the course of the first few months, Covid's overstayed welcome became evident. As we spent more and more times in our personal residences, new outlets for entertainment were created or discovered. One kind of entertainment I found was on YouTube. For many of my fellow peers, we have grown up with YouTube. And yet, there are some forms of content viewed by millions, that you would never be aware of. Due to the pandemic, I found out about Hololive. It was the start of a whole new world.</p>

          <h3>Why Hololive?</h3>
            <p>For me, and I'm sure many of you, we grew up with YouTube. It's not uncommon for us to share with our friends YouTube video. I spend most of my leisure time browsing and watching YouTube. Also, while it doesn't apply to everyone, I enjoy watching anime. The talents aren't the average YouTuber;they are virtual youtubers. Essentially there are as follows: </p>

          <h3>Where/How Hololive?</h3>
            <p>Hololive is based is Japan, the mysterious land of anime. For most people, including myself, the language serves as a barrier of entry. After all if you can't understand, then what's the point? That is where the various clipper channels come into play. A clip is small digestable portion of a long form media, like a movie or strem. They, trying to share what they like as well, take the time to translate clips of various channels into various languages. They go through streams and/or videos that are funny, memorable, touching, etc. I've personally seen English, Spanish, Chinese, and Thai and I'm pretty sure there are much more.
